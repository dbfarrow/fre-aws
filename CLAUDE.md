# CLAUDE.md — Claude Code AWS Environment

## Project Purpose

This project creates and maintains a multi-user AWS environment using Infrastructure as Code (IaC). It provisions individual EC2 instances per user that serve as persistent development environments running the Claude Code CLI. The entire toolchain is packaged as a Docker image so that non-technical Mac users can manage their AWS dev environment with minimal local setup.

## Host Machine Requirements (Mac and Windows/WSL2)

Supported platforms: **macOS** and **Windows with WSL2**.

- A container runtime:
  - macOS: Docker Desktop, OrbStack, or Rancher Desktop
  - Windows: Docker Desktop with WSL2 backend
- `git` (macOS: pre-installed or via Xcode CLI tools; Windows: use git inside WSL2)
- AWS credentials via IAM Identity Center (SSO)
- SSH key (`~/.ssh/fre-claude`) for SSH-over-SSM access

> **Windows users:** Install WSL2 first (`wsl --install`), then Docker Desktop with WSL2 backend. Clone this repo and run all commands from inside the WSL2 terminal. Keep SSH keys in `~/.ssh/` within WSL2.

---

## Development Workflow

Always use plan mode before writing any code. Use `EnterPlanMode` to explore the codebase, understand the existing patterns, and design an approach before making any changes. Get user approval on the plan before implementing.

**Debug commands:** Always write debug/diagnostic commands as a single line with no line continuations (`\`). Users copy-paste these from the terminal; multi-line commands cause paste errors.

---

## Git Workflow

This project uses **GitHub Flow**. All changes reach `main` through pull requests — no direct pushes to `main`.

### Branch naming
| Prefix | Use for |
|--------|---------|
| `feature/` | new functionality |
| `fix/` | bug fixes |
| `docs/` | documentation only |
| `chore/` | maintenance, refactoring, dependency updates |

Example: `feature/windows-wsl2-support`, `fix/spot-instance-tagging`

### Pull request rules
- **Every change to `main` goes through a PR** — no exceptions
- **Merges are performed in the GitHub UI, never automated from the CLI or from Claude**
- Use **squash-and-merge** to keep `main` history linear and readable
- PR title should be concise; description must explain *what* changed and *why*
- Keep PRs focused: one logical change per PR
- Delete the branch after merge

### Standard flow
```
git checkout -b feature/my-change   # branch from main
# ... make changes, commit frequently ...
git push -u origin feature/my-change
# Open PR in GitHub UI → review → squash-and-merge → delete branch
git checkout main && git pull        # sync local main after merge
```

### PR scope discipline (Claude-specific)
Claude should continuously ask: *has the work in progress grown beyond the reasonable scope of a single PR?* When it has — when uncommitted changes span multiple independent concerns, or when a new direction emerges mid-implementation — Claude will call this out explicitly and propose stopping to open a PR for the current work before continuing. The goal is PRs that are independently reviewable and meaningful, not large mixed-concern diffs.

## Core Principles

### Zero Trust Architecture
This project applies Zero Trust principles where free-tier AWS constraints allow:

| Principle | Applied | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| No SSH / no port 22 | ✅ | All EC2 access via SSM Session Manager (SSH tunneled over SSM) |
| No EC2 public IP | ⚠️ | Default mode (`public`) gives EC2 a public IP; `private_nat` removes it |
| No long-lived credentials | ✅ | IAM Identity Center (SSO) with short-lived session tokens |
| Least-privilege IAM | ✅ | DeveloperAccess and ProjectAdminAccess permission sets scoped per user |
| IMDSv2 enforced | ✅ | `http_tokens = "required"` on all instances |
| Encryption at rest | ✅ | KMS-backed EBS and S3 |
| Security groups deny by default | ✅ | No ingress rules on EC2 |
| Audit logging | ❌ Deferred | CloudTrail and VPC Flow Logs not enabled (cost); add before production |

### Terraform Module Strategy
All AWS resource provisioning uses **community modules from [terraform-aws-modules](https://registry.terraform.io/namespaces/terraform-aws-modules)** (maintained by Anton Babenko). Direct resource blocks are only used when no suitable module exists.

Key modules in use:
| Module | Source |
|--------|--------|
| VPC | `terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws` |
| EC2 | `terraform-aws-modules/ec2-instance/aws` |
| Security Group | `terraform-aws-modules/security-group/aws` |
| IAM Role | `terraform-aws-modules/iam/aws//modules/iam-assumable-role` |
| S3 (state bucket) | `terraform-aws-modules/s3-bucket/aws` |
| KMS | `terraform-aws-modules/kms/aws` |

Always pin modules to a specific version tag (`?ref=vX.Y.Z`) — never use `latest` or an unversioned ref.

## Multi-User Model

Each user gets their own EC2 instance, IAM Identity Center user, and S3 registry entry. Users are managed via:

```
./admin.sh add-user <username>     # Provision Identity Center user + S3 entry
./admin.sh remove-user <username>  # Remove user (--keep-sso to preserve Identity Center)
./admin.sh list                    # Show all users + instance state + timestamps
./admin.sh stat                    # Full environment status including billing
./admin.sh up <username>           # Provision EC2 instance for user
./admin.sh down <username>         # Destroy EC2 instance for user
./admin.sh start <username>        # Start stopped instance
./admin.sh stop <username>         # Stop running instance
./admin.sh connect <username>      # Connect via SSH over SSM
./admin.sh refresh <username>      # Push config updates to running instance (no rebuild)
```

**User registry** lives in S3 (not tfvars). Each entry stores: `user_email`, `role`, `git_user_name`, `git_user_email`, `ssh_public_key`.

## EC2 Session Flow

### Connection
`connect.sh` starts an ssh-agent inside Docker, loads `~/.ssh/fre-claude`, and opens SSH over an SSM tunnel (no inbound port 22). Agent forwarding (`ssh -A`) allows git operations on the EC2 using the local key.

### Session Launcher (`session_start.sh`)
On connect, `.bash_profile` fires `session_start.sh` (guarded: only on interactive SSH, never inside tmux). The menu shows:
- Numbered list of repos in `~/repos` — selecting one reattaches or creates a named tmux session
- `c` — clone a GitHub repo (prompts owner/repo, clones via SSH agent)
- `n` — create a new project directory
- `s` — open a plain shell

Each repo option launches: `claude --continue 2>/dev/null || claude; exec bash` inside a named tmux session. `--continue` resumes the last conversation; the `|| claude` fallback handles new projects with no history. `exec bash` keeps the window open after Claude exits.

### Session Persistence
tmux named sessions survive SSH/SSM disconnects. Reconnecting and selecting the same repo reattaches to the existing session — Claude picks up exactly where it left off.

### Autoshutdown
A systemd timer (`autoshutdown.timer`) runs every 5 minutes:
- **tmux sessions exist** → reset idle timer, do nothing (user is working or session is detached)
- **0 tmux sessions for 10+ minutes** → `sudo shutdown -h now`

This means: deliberately exiting Claude → `exit` the bash shell → tmux session ends → instance stops itself in ~10–15 minutes. A midnight Lambda provides a safety net for forgotten detached sessions.

**`./admin.sh refresh`** installs the autoshutdown timer live on a running instance (no rebuild needed). It also pushes `session_start.sh`, `.tmux.conf`, and patches `.bash_profile`.

## Key Technologies

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Terraform (~1.9+) | IaC provisioning via terraform-aws-modules |
| AWS CLI (v2) | SSO authentication, EC2 lifecycle, SSM sessions |
| AWS SSM Session Manager | Secure shell access — SSH tunneled over SSM, no port 22 |
| IAM Identity Center | Per-user SSO with DeveloperAccess + ProjectAdminAccess permission sets |
| tmux | Session persistence across SSH disconnects |
| Python 3 + zoneinfo | Timestamp formatting (AWS ISO 8601 → local timezone) |
| Bash | All user-facing scripts |
| Docker | Packages all tooling; users install nothing locally |

---

## Dockerfile Notes

- Base image: `debian:bookworm-slim`
- Includes: terraform, aws-cli v2, SSM session-manager-plugin, bats, openssh-client, python3, **tzdata**
- `tzdata` is required for Python `zoneinfo` to resolve named timezones (e.g. `America/Los_Angeles`)
- `run.sh` detects the host timezone and passes it as `TZ` env var into all containers
- Nothing sensitive is baked in — AWS credentials and config are mounted at runtime

---

## AWS Infrastructure

### Network
- **VPC** with public and private subnets (via `terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws`)
- Default mode: EC2 in public subnet with public IP, all inbound traffic blocked by security group
- `private_nat` mode: EC2 in private subnet + NAT Gateway (~$33/month extra)
- VPC Flow Logs: not enabled (cost); add before production

### EC2 Instance
- Deployed via `terraform-aws-modules/ec2-instance/aws`
- **Spot instances by default** — significant cost savings; falls back to on-demand if unavailable
- `user_data_replace_on_change = false` — prevents accidental instance replacement on user_data edits
- **No security group ingress rules** — only egress allowed
- **IMDSv2 required** (`http_tokens = "required"`)
- EBS volumes encrypted with a project-managed KMS key
- `developer` user has `NOPASSWD:ALL` sudo (required for autoshutdown `shutdown -h now`)

### State Management
- Remote state in **S3 with versioning, KMS encryption, public access block**
- State locking via **DynamoDB table**
- Terraform state bucket is in us-east-1 (bootstrap ran there); EC2 resources are in us-west-2 — intentional
- State bucket key per user: `terraform/<username>/terraform.tfstate`

### Scheduled Stop (Lambda)
- Midnight Lambda stops all running instances to prevent overnight charges
- Safety net for detached tmux sessions the autoshutdown timer doesn't catch

---

## Testing Strategy

### Terraform Validation (no AWS required)
```bash
terraform fmt --check
terraform validate
terraform plan
```

### Shell Script Tests (BATS)
- Test files in `tests/bats/*.bats`
- BATS is installed in the Docker image
- Run with: `./admin.sh test`

### Known Account Limits
- `ENABLE_ANOMALY_DETECTION=false` required in `config/defaults.env` (account hit dimensional monitor limit)

---

## Debugging Tips

- **Always write debug commands as a single line** — users copy-paste from the terminal; line continuations break paste
- Check autoshutdown timer: `systemctl status autoshutdown.timer`
- Check autoshutdown logs: `journalctl -u autoshutdown.service --no-pager -n 20`
- Check idle file: `cat ~/.autoshutdown-idle-since`
- Check tmux sessions: `tmux list-sessions`
- Timestamp issues: AWS `LaunchTime` is ISO 8601 with `+00:00` offset; `date -d` silently fails on this — use Python `datetime.fromisoformat` instead
- IFS gotcha: `IFS=$'\t' read` collapses consecutive tabs (bash treats tab as whitespace). Use `|` as jq output delimiter with `IFS='|' read` to handle empty fields correctly

## Security Checklist (enforce before every PR)

- [ ] No hardcoded AWS account IDs, ARNs with account IDs, or credentials
- [ ] No SSH key pairs referenced anywhere (SSH is only via SSM tunnel)
- [ ] No security group ingress rules on EC2
- [ ] All S3 buckets have `block_public_acls = true` and `block_public_policy = true`
- [ ] All EBS volumes use `encrypted = true` with a KMS key
- [ ] All EC2 instances have `http_tokens = "required"` (IMDSv2)
- [ ] All IAM policies use least-privilege (no `*` actions or resources unless justified)
- [ ] Terraform module versions are pinned to specific tags

---

## Open Decisions / Future Work

- [ ] Pre-built AMI with Claude Code to minimize boot time (currently installs on first boot)
- [ ] Automatic SSO re-authentication flow when token expires mid-session
- [ ] GitHub Actions CI for automated plan/apply
- [ ] CloudTrail + VPC Flow Logs (deferred for cost; add before production use)
